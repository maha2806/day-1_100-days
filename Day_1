###I am signing up for replit's 100 days of python challenge!
#i will make sure to some time every day coding along,for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
## i'll be using replit , an amazing online IDE so i can do this from my phone wherever
#i happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
print ("I am feeling 😍")
